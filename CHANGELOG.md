# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2026-10-26)

First release.

Gives dbt models a Jinja-aware `dbt` filetype. Tree-sitter parses a model as Jinja and hands the SQL to the SQL parser, so highlighting, folding, and indenting understand both languages.

Needs Neovim 0.12 or later and the `jinja`, `jinja_inline`, and `sql` Tree-sitter parsers.
